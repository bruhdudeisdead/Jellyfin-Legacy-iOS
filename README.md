# Jellyfin for Legacy iOS
A Jellyfin client for legacy iOS devices. That's pretty much it. You can listen to music and watch TV shows or movies.
For log in, it uses Quick Connect only for now, username and password login will be added soon.
You can either just set a server URL and leave API key blank to log in with Quick Connect, or set both server URL and API key with a key from the Dashboard of your server. Though, you won't be able to view movies.

Be warned: the code sucks. Really bad.
